This is a **forked** repository of original [Confluent Kafka Python repository](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-python).  


I have primarily worked on including example to read specific offset(from provided start to end) from specific partition .[Example code](https://github.com/devanjanmishra/confluent-kafka-python/blob/master/examples/seek_specific_offset_partition.py)
